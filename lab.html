          Your digital notes will probably be around much longer than any specific system you use for a while. The tools
          you use now should not lock you in when later on you decide to move on (with your notes).
        </p>

        <p>
          Arachne.nvim is a minimal, low-tech notetaking system for Neovim. It doesn't lock you in, you can use your
          notes with whatever you want. Arachne.nvim also works well with other tools - have a look at the <a
            href="//github.com/oem/arachne.nvim">github page</a> if you are interested in an example setup that shows
          Arachne being used together with Telescope, ripgrep and fuzzy searches. This is the setup I am currently using
          myself!

        <h3>Pollen Levels</h3>

        <p>
          Our guest dog, that we take care of now and then (as often as possible), developed an allergy to grasses. The
          poor guy. To be better prepared, I build this little dashboard that shows the pollen levels, including a 6 day
          forecast.
          It also works for humans!
        </p>
        <p>Have a look at <a href="//oem.github.io/pollen">oem.github.io/pollen</a>.</p>
        <p>
          Let's nerd out for a second :)

          The frontend was done in <a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a>, which is a delightful entry level drug to
          (pure) functional programming! It's
          also small, fast and absurdly robust, especially considering that it has to live in the very hostile browser
          environment.

          The data collection and cleaning was a breeze with <a href="https://julialang.org">julia</a>, a language my
          brain seems to like a lot!

          All of this is hosted on github, a github action will run the julia code every now and then to fetch and clean
          new data and commit the updated dataset. The frontend will request the committed dataset file directly from
          github. Oh, and is hosted as a github page.
        </p>

        <h3>Covid-19 Dashboard</h3>

        <ul class="tags">
          <li class="tag">Elm</li>
          <li class="tag">julia</li>
        </ul>

        <a href="//oem.github.io/covid19"><img src="/assets/covid19.svg" alt="covid-19 dashboard"></a>

        <p>
          We should strive to make informed decisions, especially when dealing with a pandemic. This dashboard is
          color-coded to make it very easy and intuitive to get a quick summary of the current covid situation. Like
          checking the weather.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find the running dashboard at <a href="//oem.github.io/covid19">oem.github.io/covid19</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the hood it is very similar to the pollen level page, it uses <a href="https://julialang.org">julia</a>
          to get the data, <a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> for the frontend and github for hosting and updating.
