            <h1>A Sketchy Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>
<p>I would like to try something new, at least something new for me:</p>
<p>Explore some of the core concepts of convolutional neural networks, but not by writing a huge amount of text and maybe some code snippets- there are plenty of excellent posts and papers about CNNs in exactly this format already.</p>
<p>Instead, I would like to try a different approach, asking questions about CNNs and then trying to answer them. Yes, with some text, but mostly visually.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/cnn-1.jpg" alt="cnn intro" />
<img src="/assets/cnn-2.jpg" alt="filters" />
<img src="/assets/cnn-3.jpg" alt="filter parameters" />
<img src="/assets/cnn-4.jpg" alt="padding" />
<img src="/assets/cnn-5.jpg" alt="pooling" /></p>
<p>And those were some of the key concepts of Convolutional Neural Nets.</p>
<p>We explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>cnn usecases</li>
<li>filters/kernels</li>
<li>translation invariance</li>
<li>padding</li>
<li>pooling</li>
</ul>

            </body>
