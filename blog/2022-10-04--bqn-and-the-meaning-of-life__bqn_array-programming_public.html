<h2>The meaning of life, overexplained</h2>
<p>So, what is it? <code>42</code> of course (you haven’t read Hitchhiker’s Guide yet?! What are you waiting for, go go, and have fun, it is a wonderful read!).</p>
<p>Let’s use a dash of BQN to overexplain why 42 is the meaning of life:</p>
<pre><code>  @ + 42
'*'
</code></pre>
<p>42 is the ASCII code for ‘*’, which is often used as symbol for <em>anything</em> or, in this case <strong>everything</strong>.</p>
<h2>Character Arithmetic</h2>
<p>The <code>@</code> literal acts as the null character, which in ASCII would be literally <em>0</em>. If you add the ASCII code you will get the character.</p>
<p>The BQN documentation is, as always, excellent, here it is going on about <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/arithmetic.html#character-arithmetic">character arithmetic</a> in plenty of detail.</p>
